📘 What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is:

👉 A built-in tool in GitHub
👉 Used to create CI/CD workflows

It runs automation using a YAML file.

📘 GitHub Action CI Workflow Setup (Simple)

Inside your project, create folder:

.github/workflows/


Create file:

ci.yml

Example Basic CI File:
name: Simple CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Print message
        run: echo "CI is running successfully!"


Now whenever you push to main, GitHub runs this automatically.
