    <h1>CI/CD Concept</h1>
    <p>CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a software development practice that emphasizes frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing and deployment processes. The main goal of CI/CD is to enable faster and more reliable software delivery by automating the build, test, and deployment stages.</p>
    <h2>Continuous Integration (CI)</h2>
    <p>Continuous Integration is the practice of merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository frequently, often multiple times a day. Each integration is automatically built and tested to detect errors as early as possible. This helps to ensure that the codebase remains stable and that new features or bug fixes do not introduce regressions.</p>
    <h2>Continuous Deployment (CD)</h2>
    <p>Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production after they have
passed all automated tests. This allows for faster delivery of new features and bug fixes to end-users, as there is no need for manual intervention in the deployment process. Continuous Deployment relies heavily on a robust testing suite to ensure that only high-quality code is deployed to production.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of CI/CD</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster delivery of software updates</li>
        <li>Improved code quality through automated testing</li>
        <li>Reduced risk of deployment failures</li>
        <li>Increased collaboration among development teams</li>
        <li>Greater visibility into the development process</li>
    </ul>
