📘 Best Practices for Using Git & GitHub

Using Git and GitHub properly makes your project clean, safe, and professional.

✅ 1. Write Clear Commit Messages

Bad ❌

update


Good ✅

Added login validation with error handling


Clear commits help team members understand changes.
✅ 2. Commit Small Changes

Do not commit 50 files together.
Commit feature by feature.

This makes debugging easier.

✅ 3. Use Branches Properly

Never work directly on main.

Use:

feature/login

feature/navbar

bugfix/header

hotfix/security

Then merge using Pull Request.

✅ 4. Always Pull Before Push
git pull origin main


This avoids merge conflicts.

✅ 5. Use .gitignore

Never push:

node_modules

.env

API keys

Passwords

✅ 6. Protect Main Branch

On GitHub:

Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule

Require:

Pull request

Code review

status checks
