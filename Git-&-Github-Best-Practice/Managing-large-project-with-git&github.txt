📘 Managing Large Projects with Git & GitHub

Large projects require structure.

🔹 1. Folder Structure

Organize code properly:

src/
components/
utils/
tests/
docs/

🔹 2. Use Issues & Projects

Track tasks:

Bug fixes

Features

Improvements

🔹 3. Use Tags & Releases

For versions:

git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

🔹 4. Use GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Automatically:

Run tests

Build project

Deploy

🔹 5. Use Pull Requests for Everything

Never merge directly.
